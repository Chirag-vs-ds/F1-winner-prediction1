# 🏎️ F1 Winner Predictor

This project is an AI-powered web application that predicts the winner of upcoming Formula 1 Grand Prix races using machine learning. It's built with a deep love for F1 and a passion for data science.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using past race data, driver statistics, and team performance, this app predicts the most probable winner for upcoming races. It utilizes Python's machine learning libraries to train a classification model and displays the predicted winner in an interactive web interface built with Flask.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Trained ML model using past F1 race datasets  
- 📊 Feature engineering based on driver, constructor, track, and season data  
- 🌐 Simple web UI using Flask  
- 🎨 Animated homepage with racing car visual  
- 📥 Upload your own data to test the model  
- 🔮 Get predicted winner based on input conditions  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **ML Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Deployment**: GitHub + Render (or other options like Railway/Heroku)


## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Historical F1 data is cleaned and formatted.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Categorical values like driver/team are encoded, unnecessary columns removed.

3. **Model Building**  
   A classification model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) is trained.

4. **Web Integration**  
   Flask handles form input and displays the predicted winner dynamically.
